// Exercise 29: Traversing an Event

// Subscribing to an Event and traversing an Array are fundamentally the same operation. The only difference is that Array traversal is synchronous and completes, and Event traversal is asynchronous and never completes. If we convert a button click Event to an Observable object, we can use forEach() to traverse the Event.

function exercise(button) {
  var buttonClicks = Observable.fromEvent(button, "click");

  // In the case of an Observable, forEach returns a subscription object.
  var subscription =
    buttonClicks.
      forEach(function (clickEvent) {
        alert("Button was clicked. Stopping Traversal.");

        // Stop traversing the button clicks
        subscription.dispose();
      });
}

// Notice that Observable's forEach() function returns a Subscription object. Disposing of a Subscription object unsubscribes from the event and prevents memory leaks. Disposing of a subscription is the asynchronous equivalent of stopping half-way through a counting for loop.

// Disposing of a Subscription object is basically the same as calling removeEventListener(). On the surface, these two approaches to Event handling don't seem to be very different. Under the circumstances, why should we bother converting Events to Observables? The reason is that if we convert Events to Observable Objects, we can use powerful functions to transform them. In the next exercise we'll learn how we can use one such function to avoid dealing with Subscriptions in many cases...
