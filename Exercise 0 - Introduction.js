// Functional Programming in Javascript

// Functional programming provides developers with the tools to abstract common collection operations into reusable, composable building blocks. You'll be surprised to learn that most of the operations you perform on collections can be accomplished with five simple functions:

// map
// filter
// concatAll
// reduce
// zip
// Here's my promise to you: if you learn these 5 functions your code will become shorter, more self-descriptive, and more durable. Also, for reasons that might not be obvious right now, you'll learn that these five functions hold the key to simplifying asynchronous programming. Once you've finished this tutorial you'll also have all the tools you need to easily avoid race conditions, propagate and handle asynchronous errors, and sequence events and AJAX requests. In short, these 5 functions will probably be the most powerful, flexible, and useful functions you'll ever learn.

// Finishing the Interactive Exercises

// This isn't just a tutorial, it's a series of interactive exercises that you can fill out right in your browser! It's easy to finish the exercises. Just edit the code and press "Run." If the code works, a new exercise will appear below. Otherwise an error will appear.

// Note: Use the "F4" key to toggle full screen mode for each editor.

// This tutorial may have bugs, so if you get into a weird state or you're sure you've got the right answer but can't move on, just refresh your browser. If you're using a modern browser, and if you're here I assume you are, the state of your exercises will be saved. If you want, you can also restart the lab.

// This tutorial is on [GitHub](https://github.com/jhusain/learnrx), and is asymptotically approaching completion. If you'd like to add an exercise, clarify a problem description, or fix a bug feel free to fork and send us a pull request. We'll try and fit user-contributed exercises into a narrative.
