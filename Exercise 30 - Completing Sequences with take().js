// Exercise 30: Completing Sequences with take()

// Have you ever wished that you could listen for the next occurrence of an event and then immediately unsubscribe? For example, developers will often attach an event handler to window.onload, expecting that their event handler will only be called once.

//     window.addEventListener(
//       "load",
//       function()
//         // do some work here, but expect this function will only be called once.
//       })

// In instances such as this, it's good practice to unsubscribe from the event after it's fired. Failing to unsubscribe is a memory leak. Depending on the circumstances, memory leaks can seriously destablize your application and can be very difficult to track down. Unfortunately unsubscribing from an event after one occurrence can be cumbersome:

//     var handler = function() {
//       // do some work here, then unsubscribe from the event
//       window.removeEventListener("load", handler)
//     };
//     window.addEventListener("load", handler);

// Wouldn't it be nice if there was an easier way to code this? That's why Observable has a take() function. The take() function works like this...

//     seq([1,,,2,,,3,,,4,,,5,,,6,,,]).take(3) === seq([1,,,2,,,3]);

// An Observable based on an Event will never complete on its own. The take() function creates a new sequence that completes after a discrete number of items arrive. This is important, because unlike an Event, when an Observable sequence completes it unsubscribes all of its listeners. That means that if we use take() to complete our Event sequence, we don't need to unsubscribe!

// Let's repeat the previous exercise, in which we listened for a single button click and then unsubscribed. This time let's use the take() function to complete the sequence after the button is clicked.

function exercise(button) {
  var buttonClicks = Observable.fromEvent(button, "click");

  // Use take() to listen for only one button click
  // and unsubscribe.
  buttonClicks.
    take(1).
    forEach(function () {
      alert("Button was clicked once. Stopping Traversal.");
    });
}

// The take() function is great way of listening for a discrete number of events and then unsubscribing, but Observable has an even more flexible function that we can use to complete sequences...
